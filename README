Term/WinConsole version 0.01
============================

This module allows you to handle windows, cursor and colors on a terminal.

First of all, WinConsole uses ANSI sequences so don't expect to use it if your terminal is not ANSI/VT100 compliant.

WinConsole uses a backbuffer to build your screens. This means that all printing operations are invisible to the user until the next terminal refresh. WinConsole implements two methods for screen display. The first is a simple refresh method that just prints the backbuffer on the terminal. The second prints only differences between the terminal and the back buffer. Thanks to this feature, WinConsole allows you to greatly improve terminal applications performance by reducing the amount of data sent other the net.

WinConsole allows you to manage independent regions of text called miniwins. Each miniwin has its own backbuffer so it can be moved around the screen and overlapped as you wish. they can even be resized under some restrictions.
